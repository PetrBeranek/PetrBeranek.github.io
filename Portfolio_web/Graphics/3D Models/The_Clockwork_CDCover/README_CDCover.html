<h1>CD cover</h1>

<p>
Finished in December 2014</br>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Reason to create project:</h3>

This project was created for course GRT [1] during my bachelor studies.</br>
Task was to create anything containing several photographies, renders, drawing or paintings. There had to be text (several paragraphs) and some ornament.</br>
</p>

<h3>About project:</h3>

I decided to create CD cover for a game (The Clockwork) we were creating with friends. </br>
I reused several of my older projects (Mechanoid (brass robot) for main character, Arien as silhouette in background and wolves used in The Clockwork ).</br>
Text was very loosely based on The Clockwork story (it is written in Czech language). As ornament I used "shards" (green spiky marks behind "The Clockwork") and my logo ("Sheepworks" logo).</br>
</br>

<b>Resources:</b></br>
All models were created by me in Maya 2014(or reused from my older projects) and rendered by Mental Ray.</br>
"Shards", "Sheepworks" logo and text frames were created in Inkscape.</br>
Final composition was done in GIMP.</br>

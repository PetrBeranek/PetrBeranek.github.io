<h1>The Clockwork</h1>

<b>Authors:</b> Petr Beránek, Roman Janovský, David Futschik</br>
Project finished in December 2014</br>
</br>
<h3>Reason to create project:</h3>
This project was created with two of my friends during our bachelor studies for course PHA [1]</br>
Task was to design and implement game in teams of 3-4 students. </br>
Engine used for the game was Unity and we were using Maya for creating models.</br>
</br>
My role in team was designing the game, creating models and building in-game world. Only code written by me in this game is ButterflyController which controls movement of jet propelled butterflies flying in main menu scene.</br>
(Before this project I never imagined how time consuming it will be, to create so many models for a game.)</br>
</br>
<h3>About story:</h3>
Our game, The Clockwork, is open-world RPG (Just intro mission, there was no time to make whole game.). Main hero is an aluminium robot in mechanical world plagued by mysterious fast spreading rust.</br>
He is relatively young and he loves to discover new places. One day he happens to be on one such place, but he doesn't know it yet. And that is where the story starts.</br>
</br>
<h3>About game:</h3>
Our main goal was to create an open world RPG which will be as different from other games as possible. I had the idea about non-realistic machine-populated world where only( or mostly) robots live for very long time.</br>
My idea was more about 3D platform game where hero would have to fight his way from one point to another and he would evolve by using parts of fallen enemies, in order to become stronger, get abilities to overcome new obstacles and be able to fight more powerful opponents.</br>
Unfortunately this wouldn't be be possible to finish it in just 14 weeks in quality we wanted. So we decided to make RPG. Many ideas weren't implemented because of lack of time but most of my ideas were implemented.   </br>
</br>
<h3>Things in game designed or created by me:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>terrain for initial mission </li>
	<li>all concept arts</li>
	<li>all models except some trees (all of the realistic looking trees are not made by me)</li>
	<li>most of textures (skybox, terrain and some trees are not done by me)</li>
	<li>ButterflyControlled (State machine making jet propelled butterflies fly in specified range above ground and to move relatively randomly)</li>
	</ul>
<h3>My ideas that were used:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>mechanical world (most of the world is made of metal, even some trees)</li>
	<li>highly stylized, cartoonish graphics</li>
	<li>3D GUI</li>
	<li>health as oil pressure</li>
	<li>energy as electricity</li>
	<li>hero requires energy to make almost every action (even standing still, player must be aware of energy, running out of energy in combat can be fatal)</li>
	<li>when hero is out of energy, player must spin the crank of dynamo to generate electricity</li>
	<li>hero is mechanical, his parts (arms, legs, backpack) can be exchanged for better</li>
	<li>combo attacks</li>
	</ul>

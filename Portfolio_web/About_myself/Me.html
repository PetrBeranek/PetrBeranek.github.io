<h1>Me</h1>

<h4>about me:</h4>
<p>
My name is Petr Beránek. Currently I am a student of computer graphics and interaction at Faculty of Electrical Engineering of Czech Technical University in Prague.
My strengths are especially my creativity and imagination. These skills I use mostly in art, 3D models and sculpturing but also in other thinks I do. I like challenging work and opportunities to learn something new.  
I always want to have things done and sometimes its is hard for me to stop, if they are not. I am well organised and responsible with good time management.

</p>
<h4>hobbies:</h4>

<p>
My hobbies are art, sculpturing, 3D modelling, historical reenactment (the closest English translation of "historický šerm" I found) and computer games. I also love music and films.</p>
<p>Since I was young I like drawing with pencils and ball-point pens. I used to draw a lot during high school, now I draw mostly to create concept arts for my other creations. But the drawings were usually not enough for me. I love to create sculptures. 
I was creating sculptures (mostly creatures and castles) from plasticine since I was young. Later I started with sculptures made of wire. Now I create wire sculptures rarely and only as gifts, since I found out 3D modelling(it gives bigger freedom and models last longer and are much cheaper to create).</p>
<p>I started with historical reenactment when I was 14. Since then I have spent lot of time doing this hobby. I am a member of the project <a href="http://slanskarota.cz/">"Slánská rota"</a>. We reconstruct militia of town Slaný from 1469 to 1474.</p>
<p>When I have free time, I like to play computer games. To my list of the most favourite ones belong games and series such as Lineage II, Guild Wars 2, Bioshock series, Diablo and Starcraft series, Dead Space series, Space Engineers, Minecraft, Don't Starve or Ori and the Blind Forest. 
But the game, that influenced me the most (and especially my creations) is The Neverhood.</p>

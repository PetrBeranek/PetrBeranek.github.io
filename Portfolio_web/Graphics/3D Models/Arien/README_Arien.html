<h1>Arien</h1>

<p>
Finished in July 2014</br>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Reason to create project:</h3>
This project was created in free time. I wanted to recreate one of my wire statues, but this time in more mechanical way. </br>
</p>

<h3>About project:</h3>

Project was created in Maya 2014 (Student licence), rendered by MentalRay.

Scene contains Arien, mechanical monster with four arms made of steel plates, pistons and cog wheels.</br>
all pistons and wheels are tied together using expressions and constraints so they seems to work while Arien moves.</br>
During this project I learnt that even thou model looks great in Maya, when exported into other formats they can be highly altered (And that using scale less than 0 instead of mirroring may look good in maya, but it messes up the normals).
Another thing learned during creation was that parenting parts to skeleton instead of skinning is faster, but can cause big problems then exported.</br>
Despite these problems (which I will have to solve once I decide to use this model) model  came out better than I expected in beginning.</br>
I also managed to keep triangle count as low as I could (30 thousands). </br>
</br>
Scene is expected to be used in Maya. Exported .fbx file probably doesn't have all the functions or correct look. (.fbx scene is just for preview or to access models even without Maya)</br>

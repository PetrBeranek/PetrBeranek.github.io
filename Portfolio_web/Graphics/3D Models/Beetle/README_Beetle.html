<h1>Beetle</h1>

<p>
Finished in December 2013</br>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Reason to create project:</h3>

This project was created for course MGA [1] during my bachelor studies.</br>
Task was to create model of any car we wanted. I choose to create beetle, because of its round shape.</br>
</p>

<h3>About project:</h3>

Project was created in Blender, renders were made using Blender renderer.</br>
</br>
This was the first 3D model I have ever created. It is not perfect and now I would make it differently and more detailed, but I am still proud of it. </br>
Scene contains, as name suggests, Volkswagen Beetle.</br>
